Connect 4 is a popular board game made from 7 columns and 6 rows. Players take turns dropping their coloured disks into columns until 
one of the players gets 4 in a row-horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The goal of this project is to build two Connect 4 boards 
that will use sensors, motors and microcontrollers to detect user input, process it and send it to the other board. The system will 
also keep truck of whose turn it is check for win, lose or draw case and do remote players moves automatically.
